							<h2>Demo Page for 'Keywords Finder' (built with ReactJS)</h2>
							<p>The 'Keywords Finder' feature lists the most used words in the article, not including common
				 					words such as 'I', 'the', 'can' e.t.c. The user has the ability to
				 				</p>
				 			<ul>
								<li>highlight the keywords all at once, or individually,</li>
								<li>display the number of times a keyword is used</li>
								<li>select the number of keywords to display</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The aim of the feature is to help the reader
								get a quick overview of the article by displaying and highlighting the most used words, as well as to help
								the reader scan the article quickly.
				 			</p>
							<p>The feature could also be useful in terms of storing the keywords for each
									article, and then using the keywords to find similar and related articles.
									The method could help increase the relevance of articles found in 'related article'
				 					suggestions.</p>
