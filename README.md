'Keywords Finder' (built with ReactJS)

The 'Keywords Finder' feature lists the most used words in the article, not including common words such as 'I', 'the', 'can' e.t.c. The user has the ability to

highlight the keywords all at once, or individually,
display the number of times a keyword is used
select the number of keywords to display
The aim of the feature is to help the reader get a quick overview of the article by displaying and highlighting the most used words, as well as to help the reader scan the article quickly.

The feature could also be useful in terms of storing the keywords for each article, and then using the keywords to find similar and related articles. The method could help increase the relevance of articles found in 'related article' suggestions.
